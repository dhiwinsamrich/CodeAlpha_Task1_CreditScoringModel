# Credit Scoring Model

## Project Overview
🚀 Exciting Project Update from My Internship at CodeAlpha! 🚀

I am thrilled to share a major milestone from my internship at CodeAlpha! 🎉

### Credit Scoring Model

📊 **Project Title:** Development of a Credit Scoring Model

As part of my role, I developed a comprehensive credit scoring model to predict the creditworthiness of individuals using historical financial data. This project was a deep dive into the world of data science, involving the use of cutting-edge machine learning techniques.

## Project Highlights
🌟 **Project Highlights:**
1. **Objective:** Predict individual creditworthiness to aid financial institutions in decision-making.
2. **Data Used:** Historical financial data encompassing various metrics such as credit history, outstanding debts, and repayment behavior.
3. **Algorithms Implemented:**
   - Random Forest
   - K Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
   - Decision Tree

## Methodology
🔍 **Methodology:**
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and normalizing the data to ensure accuracy.
2. **Feature Selection:** Identifying the most relevant features influencing creditworthiness.
3. **Model Training and Testing:**
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

## Results
📈 **Results:**
